        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Kenaw Nuru! I graduated from KIIT University in 2021 with a CGPA of 9.27 in Electronics and Computer Science Engineering. 
            After graduating, I worked for two years at Kuriftu Paper Mill Factory in Ethiopiaâ€”one year as an Electrical and Instrument Trainee Engineer 
            and one year as a Shift In-Charge. During my time there, I developed strong leadership skills, was a fast learner, and worked effectively in teams. 
            Currently, I am pursuing an MTech in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Madras since July 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about problem-solving, web and app development, and advancing my knowledge in computer science. 
        </p>
